# Project 1 - *Unit1-Jayde*

Submitted by: **Jayde Shaw**

Welcome to the "My Story" app, where you can explore brief details about my life. You'll have the freedom to navigate between three screens, each offering a glimpse into different facets of my personal life. Whenever you're ready, a quick tap will guide you back to the home screen, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience as you delve into my unique story.

Time spent: 15+ Hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✅] Users are able to see a customized app icon and launch screen
- [✅] Your app should work for any screen size and orientation using AutoLayout constraints
  - [❌] Mark here if you will demostrate auto layout implemention as horizontal rotation or different phone size or both, then erase this text
- [✅] Users are able to see at least 3 context items
- [✅] Users are able to tap into each context item and see detail view contains information about each item (title, description, picture if applicable, etc.)
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [✅] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [❌] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [❌] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!



   
## Notes

I had several challenges while working in Xcode. First, I couldn't get the screen to flip and display everything correctly; it seemed to be an issue with the rotation. Second, the constraints were the trickiest part for me; I struggled to figure out how to make everything align properly. Another problem was getting all of the labels to stack correctly within the view, and I had difficulty making the tap gesture work as intended. Eventually, I had to start over with the entire project, and although I managed to get everything else to work, the constraint functions still posed a challenge when rotating the screen.
